        <h2>Milk Diary</h2>
        <p>Entry #49 – The Milk Returns. We killed it, burned the jug, buried the ashes. For a day the fridge was silent. This morning it hummed again, and the milk sat on the shelf, full and sweating, expiration date unchanged. Fire, salt, distance—nothing stops it. The milk finds us on the table, in the sink, in our dreams. It cannot be destroyed. The milk returns.</p>
